function blockface_correct_perspective(indir, files55, tform, outdir)
% blockface_correct_perspective  Correct perspective of Bewster angle
% blockface images.
%
% blockface_correct_perspective(INDIR, FILES55, TFORM, OUTDIR)
%
%   INDIR is a string with the directory where the input files are kept.
%
%   FILES55 is the result of a dir() command with a list of the files to
%   correct.
%
%   TFORM is a projective2d object with the transform correction for the
%   frames.
%
%   OUTDIR is a string with the directory for output images. INDIR and
%   OUTDIR must be different to avoid overwriting the input files.
