function im = blockface_imread_gray(file_expr)
% BLOCKFACE_IMREAD_GRAY  Read multiple image files into grayscale volume.
%
% blockface_imread_gray reads a list of image files, converts them to
% grayscale if necessary, and collates them to form a 3D image volume.
%
% IM = blockface_imread_gray(FILE_EXPR)
%
%   FILE_EXPR is a string with an expression passed to dir() to list the
%   blockface image files, e.g. '/data/blockface/*.bmp' or
%   'C:\data\blockface\*.bmp'.
%
%   IM is the resulting image volume.
