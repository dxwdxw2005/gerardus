function [ellipmask, polymask, immean] = blockface_create_masks(indir, files)
% blockface_create_masks  User interface to create the elliptical and
% polygonal segmentation masks used to correct blockface illumination.
%
% blockface_create_mask shows an average of the whole blockface volume, and
% prompts the user to draw an ellipse tightly around the heart. Then, it
% prompts the user to draw a polygon around the block's edge. Both drawings
% are converted to binary segmentation masks. Those masks can then be used
% in blockface_equalise_illumination() to correct the blockface
% illumination.
%
% [ELLIPMASK, POLYMASK] = blockface_create_masks(INDIR, FILES)
%
%   INDIR is a string with the directory where the input files are kept.
%
%   FILES is the result of a dir() command with a list of the files to
%   correct.
%
%   ELLIPMASK, POLYMASK are binary segmentations of the elliptical and
%   polygonal masks drawn by the user.
%
% [..., IMMEAN] = blockface_create_masks(FILE_EXPR)
%
%   IMMEAN is the average blockface intensity image shown to the user. This
%   can be useful for debugging purposes.
