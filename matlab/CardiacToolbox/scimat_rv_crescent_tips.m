function [tip1, tip2] = scimat_rv_crescent_tips(scimat, m)
% SCIMAT_RV_CRESCENT_TIPS  Extract the tips of the crescent-shaped curve
% in all slices of the Right Ventricle.
%
% [X1, X2] = scimat_rv_crescent_tips(SCIMAT, M)
%
%   X1, X2 are 3-colum matrices where each row are the real world
%   coordinates of each of the tips of the RV crescent shape.
%
%   SCIMAT is the struct with the RV segmentation mask (see "help scimat"
%   for details).
%
%   M is a 3-column matrix, where each row has the real world coordinates
%   of a centroid (typically, the central Left Ventricle's central curve
%   computed with scimat_centroids()). There must be as many centroids as
%   slices. Centroids with NaN coordinates will be skipped.
%
%   In the case of a RV slice that has no corresponding LV centroid, the
%   closest LV centroid will be used.
