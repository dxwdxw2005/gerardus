function blockface_correct_frame_shifts(indir, files, t, idxprop, idxnoprop, outdir)
% blockface_correct_frame_shifts  Correct shift between blockface image
% frames.
%
% When the wax block is sliced with a microtome, and photographs taken of
% the blockface, artifacts invariable happen. Artifacts are typically
% caused by the microtome tray not being pushed all the way back
% (translation artifacts), or by the camera, mirrors or any other elements
% in the light path being moved a little (similarity transform artifacts).
%
% This function assumes that the corrective transforms between consecutive
% frames have been already computed with elastix. The user provides a list
% of frames that need to be corrected, and blockface_correct_frame_shifts
% computes the accumulated transform for each frame, and applies it with
% transformix. Corrected images are saved with the same name as input
% images, but to a different directory.
%
% blockface_correct_frame_shifts(INDIR, FILES, T, IDXPROP, IDXNOPROP, OUTDIR)
%
%   INDIR is a string with the directory where the input files are kept.
%
%   FILES is the result of a dir() command with a list of the files to
%   correct.
%
%   T is a struct array where T(I) is the correction that registers image I
%   to image I-1. T can be obtained with blockface_intraframe_reg.
%
%   IDXPROP is a vector with a list of indices of frames that need to be
%   corrected, and whose correction has to propagate to subsequent frames.
%   For example, if the camera is moved a bit at frame I=30, that
%   displacement is going to show up in all frames from I=30 onwards.
%
%   IDXNOPROP is a vector with a list of indices of frames that need to be
%   corrected, but whose correction does not propagate. For example, if the
%   microtome tray is not pushed all the way in in frame I=30, that doesn't
%   mean that that problem will appear in frame I = 31. This is useful if
%   e.g. the camera has been very stable, but now and then the human
%   operator doesn't push the tray all the way back, as it avoids
%   unncessary small transforms and resampling of images.
%
%   OUTDIR is a string with the directory for output images. INDIR and
%   OUTDIR must be different to avoid overwriting the input files.
