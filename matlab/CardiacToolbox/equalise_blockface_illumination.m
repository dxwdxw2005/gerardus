% EQUALISE_BLOCKFACE_ILLUMINATION  Correct illumination inhomogeneities in
% blockface photography.
%
% This function dilates a polygonal mask of the wax block so that it
% overlaps a bit with the background. Then, it obtains a rough segmentation
% of the heart using a threshold, and removes everything outside an
% elliptical mask. The wax block pixels minus the heart segmentation pixels
% are used to estimate the slow varying illumination of the block, and
% extrapolate to all pixels on the block. Finally, the image is corrected
% dividing by the estimated illumination.
%
% [IMEQ, ILLU] = equalise_blockface_illumination(IM, POLYMASK, ELLIPMASK)
%
%   IM is a grayscale or RGB blockface photograph of a wax embedded heart.
%
%   POLYMASK is a binary mask with the same size as IM. In POLYMASK, pixels
%   with value 1 belong to the wax block, and pixels with value 0 belong to
%   the background. This mask can be created drawing a polygonal line in
%   Matlab, and then converting it to a binary mask. This mask should be
%   drawn close enough to the edges so that when the algorithm dilates it,
%   it overlaps a bit with the background outside the wax block.
%
%     % display blockface image on the screen
%     him = imagesc(im);
%     % start polygonal line tool
%     h = impoly;
%     % now you can draw the mask on the screen with the mouse
%     polymask = createMask(h, him);
%     save('polymask.mat', 'polymask')
%
%   ELLIPMASK is a binary mask too. In ELLIPMASK, pixels equal to 1
%   correspond to the inside of an ellipse that contains the heart. This
%   mask can be generated similarly to POLYMASK, replacing impoly by
%
%     % start ellipse drawing tool
%     h = imellipse;
%
%   IMEQ is a grayscale image with the same size as IM, with the
%   illumination corrected.
%
%   ILLU is an image with the same size as IM, containing the estimate of
%   the illumination within POLYMASK.
%
% ... = equalise_blockface_illumination(..., RATIO, THR, RADHEART, RADPOLY)
%
%   RATIO is a scalar with the scale factor applied to reduce the image to
%   speed up the estimation of the illumination field. By default,
%   RATIO=1/16.
%
%   THR is a scalar with the intensity threshold for the rough heart
%   segmentation. By default, THR=45.
%
%   RADHEART is a scalar with the radius of the dilation applied to the
%   rought heart segmentation. By default, RADHEART=10.
%
%   RADPOLY is a scalar with the radius of the dilation applied to
%   POLYMASK.
%
%   Example:
%
%     % load blockface image
%     im = imread('test/R_55_0001.bmp');
%
%     % load polygonal and elliptical masks
%     load('test/polymask.mat')
%     load('test/ellipmask.mat')
%
%     % set parameters
%     ratio = 1/16;
%     thr = 45;
%     radheart = 10;
%     radpoly = 50;
%
%     % correct illumination
%     [imeq, illu] = equalise_blockface_illumination(im, polymask, ...
%     ellipmask, ratio, thr, radheart, radpoly);
