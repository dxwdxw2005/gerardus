function [imref, im] = histology_preprocessing(imref, im)
% histology_preprocessing  Prepare slices for intra-histology registration.
%
% histology_preprocessing converts two histology images to grayscale,
% inverts and thresholds (so that the background is black instead of
% white), extends the histograms to cover the dynamic range, and then
% matches the histograms. This prepares them to be registered.
%
% [IMREF2, IM2] = histology_preprocessing(IMREF, IM)
%
%   IMREF, IM are two input histology images (in RGB colour or grayscale
%   format). When histograms are matched, IM is matched to IMREF.
%
%   IMREF2, IM2 are the output images after preprocessing.
