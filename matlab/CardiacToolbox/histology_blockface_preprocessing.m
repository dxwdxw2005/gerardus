function [imh, imbf] = histology_blockface_preprocessing(imh, imbf, polymask, ellipmask)
% histology_blockface_preprocessing  Prepare histology and blockface for
% registration.
%
% histology_blockface_preprocessing takes a histology and blockface images
% that are going to be registered onto each other, and: 1) inverts them, to
% have a dark background, 2) corrects the scratches of the blockface, 3)
% thresholds the background, to remove noise, 4) extends the histograms to
% cover the intensity range and 5) matches the histology histogram to the
% blockface histogram.
%
% This function should be run after homogenising the illumination in the
% blockface with blockface_equalise_illumination. It is also assumed that
% the blockface has been rotated to make the scratches horizontal.
%
% [IMH2, IMBF2] = histology_blockface_preprocessing(IMH, IMBF, POLYMASK, ELLIPMASK)
%
%   IMH, IMBF are colour or grayscale images with the histology and
%   blockface, respectively.
%
%   POLYMASK, ELLIPMASK are segmentation masks for the blockface image
%   IMBF. POLYMASK is an outline of the wax blockface. ELLIPMASK is an
%   ellipse that contains the heart. The masks can be created with
%   blockface_create_masks.
%
%   IMH2, IMBF2 are the corresponding images after preprocessing.
%
% See also: blockface_create_masks, blockface_equalise_illumination.
