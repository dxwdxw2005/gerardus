function isTangled = sphtri_vertex_istangled(tri, latlon, vidx)
% SPHTRI_VERTEX_ISTANGLED Find tangled vertices in a spherical triangular
% mesh.
%
% ISTANGLED = sphtri_vertex_istangled(TRI, LATLON)
%
%   TRI is a 3-column matrix. Each row represents the indices of the three
%   vertices that form a triangle. TRI as a whole represents the closed
%   spherical surface. Usually, TRI will come from a non-spheric closed
%   surface mesh, where the triangles are correctly oriented (i.e. normals
%   pointing outwards and positive areas). The spherical parameterization
%   of the vertices can flip triangles (normals pointing inwards and
%   negative areas).
%
%   LATLON is a 2-column matrix with the latitude and longitude coordinates
%   of the vertices' coordinates.
%
%   ISTANGLED is a boolean vector with one element per vertex in LATLON.
%   ISTANGLED(i)==true means that the corresponding vertex is tangled. We
%   define a vertex as tangled if any of its incident triangles has a
%   negative area (i.e. if the triangle normal points inwards).
