function [x0, exitflag] = vertex_untangle(tri, x)
% VERTEX_UNTANGLE  Location of a 2D vertex at the centre of a closed fan
% triangular mesh so that we avoid edge overlapping.
%
% This function is an enhanced implementation of the 2D case (i.e. each
% simplex is a triangle) of the "Optimization-based mesh untangling"
% solution proposed by Freitag and Plassmann (2000). The differences are:
%
%   - The original paper contains an error in the sign of "c" in the linear
%     programming inequalities. The correct problem formulation is
%
%       max b^T \pi (equivalenty: min -b^T \pi)
%       such that A^T \pi <= -c
%
%   - Instead of the simplex method, we use Matlab's linprog default,
%   'interior-point'
%   (http://www.mathworks.co.uk/help/optim/ug/linprog.html).
%
%   - The paper assumes that the triangles are correctly oriented such that
%     the correct position of the central voxel makes all areas positive.
%     In practice, we don't know that. Thus, this function computes 
%     solutions for one orientation of the perimeter vertices and the
%     opposite, and chooses whichever solution is correct. If both are
%     correct, the one with the largest minimum area is chosen.
%
% Let TRI, X describe a closed fan triangular mesh. That is, we have a
% central or free vertex connected to N neighbours. The neighbours are
% connected between them to form a closed perimeter.
%
% We want to find the coordinates X0 for the free vertex, such that the
% edges that connect vertices don't overlap. The N neighbours remain fixed.
% If the free vertex was already producing any overlaps (i.e. the mesh was
% entangled), this can be seen as an untangling algorithm.
%
% X0 = vertex_untangle(TRI, X);
%
%   TRI is a 3-column matrix. Each row contains the 3 nodes that form one
%   triangular facet in the mesh.
%
%   X is a 2-column matrix. X(i, :) contains the xy-coordinates of the
%   i-th node in the mesh. Note that Freitag and Plassmann (2000) also
%   provided the solution for the 3D case (i.e. each simplex is a
%   tetrahedron), but we haven't implemented it here yet.
%
%   X0 is a 2-vector with the optimal coordinates of the central (a.k.a.
%   free) vertex, in a linear programming sense, 
%
% [X0, EXITFLAG] = vertex_untangle(...)
%
%   EXITFLAG is the exit condition of the algorithm.
%
%     1: The algorithm has converged.
%     0: Maximum number of iterations reached.
%    -1: No valid solution.
