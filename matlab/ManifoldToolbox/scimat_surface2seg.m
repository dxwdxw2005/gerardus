function scimat = scimat_surface2seg(scimat, tri, x)
% scimat_surface2seg  Convert triangular mesh into segmentation.
%
%   scimat_surface2seg sets to "1" those voxels in a segmentation volume
%   that contain or are intersected by the triangles in a triangular mesh.
%   The method works by sampling each triangle in the mesh uniformly, using
%   barycentric coordinates. Samples are close enough to each other so that
%   each voxel will have at least two samples. Then sample coordinates are
%   rounded to the closest voxel centres, and the voxels are set.
%
% SCIMAT2 = scimat_surface2seg(SCIMAT, TRI, X)
%
%   SCIMAT is a struct to hold the segmentation (see "help scimat" for
%   details). SCIMAT.axis must be provided. SCIMAT.axis is important
%   because it tells us where the segmentation volume begings and ends, and
%   the voxel size. SCIMAT.data is not necessary, and if it is not
%   provided, a new one will be created. If it is provided, previously set
%   voxels will not be cleared.
%
%   (TRI, X) describe the triangular mesh.
% 
%   TRI is a 3-column matrix. Each row contains the 3 nodes that form one
%   triangular facet in the mesh.
%
%   X is a 2-column matrix. X(i, :) contains the xy-coordinates of the
%   i-th node in the mesh.
%
%   SCIMAT2 is the output segmentation.
