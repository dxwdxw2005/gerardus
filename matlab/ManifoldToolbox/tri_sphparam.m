% TRI_SPHPARAM  Spherical parametrization of closed triangular mesh.
%
% [Y, YISVALID, STOPCONDITION, SIGMA, SIGMA0, T] = tri_sphparam(TRI, X, METHOD)
%
%   TRI is a 3-column matrix with a surface mesh triangulation. Each row
%   gives the indices of one triangle. The mesh needs to be a 2D manifold,
%   that can be embedded in 2D or 3D space. The orientation of the
%   triangles does not matter.
%
%   X is a 3-column matrix with the coordinates of the mesh vertices. Each
%   row gives the (x,y,z)-coordinates of one vertex.
%
%   METHOD is a string that selects the parametrization method:
%
%     'cmdscale': Classical Multidimensional Scaling (MDS).
%
%     'smacof':   Unconstrained SMACOF, followed by projection of points on
%                 sphere.
%
%     'consmacof-global': Constrained SMACOF with untangling of all
%                 vertices simulataneously (too slow except for small
%                 problems).
%
%     'consmacof-local': Constrained SMACOF with local untangling of
%                 connected vertices. If the algorithm cannot find a way to
%                 untangle a local component, it leaves its vertices
%                 untouched.
%
%   Y is a 3-column matrix with the coordinates of the spherical
%   parametrization of the mesh. Each row contains the (x,y,z)-coordinates
%   of a point on the sphere. Y is the best valid solution found by the
%   algorithm within all iterations (including the intial guess). If no
%   valid solution could be found, the initial guess is returned. To
%   compute the spherical coordinates of the points, run
%
%     [lon, lat, r] = cart2sph(y(:, 1), y(:, 2), y(:, 3));
%
%   YISVALID is a boolean flag that indicates whether a valid solution
%   could be found and returned.
%
%   STOPCONDITION is a cell array with a string for each stop condition
%   that made the algorithm stop at the last iteration.
%
%   SIGMA is a scalar, vector or cell array with stress values. A value of
%   NaN means that the algorithm could not find a valid solution in the
%   corresponding iteration. The format and meaning of SIGMA is different
%   for each method:
%
%     'cmdscale': Single value with the stress of the solution using the
%                 full distance matrix.
%
%     'smacof':   Vector with the stress at each SMACOF iteration. Stress
%                 values are expected to be monotonically decreasing. Note
%                 that these stress values are computed without projecting
%                 the iteration solution onto a sphere, so SIGMA(end) will
%                 be different from the stress of the returned spherical
%                 solution.
%
%     'consmacof-global': Vector with the stress at each constrained SMACOF
%                 iteration. min(STRESS) equals the stress of the best
%                 solution found by SMACOF. However, if this solution is
%                 worse than the initial guess, the latter is returned, and
%                 its stress will be different from min(STRESS).
%
%     'consmacof-local': Cell array. Each array contains a vector with the
%                 stress values of the constrained SMACOF optimisation of a
%                 connected tangled component. The stress in each cell is
%                 computed taking into account only the vertices of that
%                 component. Thus, these values will be quite different
%                 from the stress of the whole final solution.
%
%   SIGMA0 is a scalar with the stress value of the initial guess Y0. Note
%   that we have no guarantee that Y0 is a valid solution, so be careful
%   when comparing SIGMA0 to SIGMA. In particular, SIGMA0 may be smaller
%   than any SIGMA, but may not be a solution where all triangles have
%   positive area.
%
%   T is a vector with the time between the beginning of the algorithm and
%   each iteration. Units in seconds.
%
%   In 'consmacof-local', STOPCONDITION, SIGMA and T are cell arrays, with
%   the output parameters for each connected component untangled by the
%   algorithm.
%
%
% ... = tri_sphparam(..., D, Y0, SPHPARAM_OPTS, SMACOF_OPTS, SCIP_CONS)
%
%   D is the square distance matrix. For 'cmdscale', D must be a full
%   matrix. For the other methods, it can be a sparse or full matrix.
%   D(i,j)=0 means that the distance between vertices i and j is not
%   considered for the stress measure.
%
%   Y0 is an initial guess for the output parametrization. For 'cmdscale',
%   Y0 must be empty. For SMACOF methods, the choice of Y0 is important
%   because the algorithm can be trapped into local minima.
%
%   SPHPARAM_OPTS is a struct with parameters to tweak the spherical
%   parametrization algorithm.
%
%     'Display': (default = 'off') Do not display any internal information.
%                'iter': display internal information at every iteration.
%
%     'TopologyCheck': (default false) Check that parametrization has no
%                self-intersections and that all triangles have a positive
%                orientation.
%
%     'volmin':  (default 0) Only used by constrained SMACOF methods.
%                Minimum volume allowed to the oriented spherical
%                tetrahedra at the output, formed by the triangles and the
%                centre of the sphere. Note that if volmin>0, then all
%                output triangles have outwards-pointing normals.
%
%     'volmax':  (default Inf) Only used by constrained SMACOF methods.
%                Maximum volume of the output tetrahedra (see 'volmin').
%
%     'LocalConvexHull': (default true) Only used by 'consmacof-local' 
%                method. When a local neighbourhood is tangled, untangle
%                the convex hull that contains it. The reason is that
%                untangling a convex domain is simpler, and it produces
%                better quality solutions.
%
%   SMACOF_OPTS is a struct with parameters to tweak the SMACOF algorithm.
%   See cons_smacof_pip for details.
%
%   SCIP_OPTS is a struct with parameters to tweak the SCIP algorithm. See
%   cons_smacof_pip for details.
