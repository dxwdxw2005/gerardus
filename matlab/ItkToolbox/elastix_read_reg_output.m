function [t, im, iterInfo] = elastix_read_reg_output(outdir)
% elastix_read_reg_output  Read output of registration computed with
% elastix.
%
% [T, IM, ITERINFO] = elastix_read_reg_output(OUTDIR)
%
%   OUTDIR is a string with the path to the output directory created by
%   elastix.
%
%   T is a struct with the contents of the parameter transform file
%   (OUTDIR/TransformParameters.0.txt). See elastix for details.
%
%   IM is the result image of the elastix registration (e.g.
%   OUTDIR/result.0.png, OUTDIR/result.0.jpg).
%
%   ITERINFO is a struct with the details of the elastix optimization
%   (OUTDIR/IterationInfo.0.R0.txt). See elastix for details.
