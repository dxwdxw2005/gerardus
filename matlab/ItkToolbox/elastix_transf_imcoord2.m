function x = elastix_transf_imcoord2(x, t)
% elastix_transf_imcoord  Convert 2D pixel coordinates using
% elastix/transformix transform.
%
% Let x be the (x, y)-coordinates of a pixel in an image (instead of
% row/column). This function computes the coordinates that the same pixel
% will have in the new image after transformix or elastix transforms.
%
% XT = elastix_transf_imcoord2(X, T)
%
%   X is a two-column matrix with the Cartesian coordinates of one or more
%   points in the input image.
%
%   T is a struct produced by elastix with the details of the image
%   transformation. See help elastix for details.
%
%   XT has the same size as X, and contains the coordinates of the same
%   points in the output image.
%
% See also: elastix, transformix, elastix_read_file2param,
% elastix_read_reg_output, elastix_write_param2file.
