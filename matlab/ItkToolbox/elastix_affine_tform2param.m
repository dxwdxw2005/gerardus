function v = elastix_affine_tform2param(tform, type)
% elastix_affine_tform2param  Convert Matlab tform affine transform to
% elastix parameter vector.
%
% V = elastix_affine_tform2param(TFORM, TYPE)
%
%   TFORM is a Matlab tform with a TYPE='translation', 'rigid',
%   'similarity' or 'affine' transform.
%
%   Currently, only similarity transform is implemented.
%
%   V is a vector with the transform parameters in the format used by
%   elastix and ITK:
%
%     'similarity': [s theta tx ty]
%
%   If TFORM is a vector of structs, then V is a matrix, with one row per
%   element in TFORM.
