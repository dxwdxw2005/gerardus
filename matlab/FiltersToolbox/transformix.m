function imout = transformix(t, im, opts)
% transformix  Matlab interface to the image warping program "transformix".
%
% transformix is a simple interface to the command line program
% "transformix"
%
%   http://elastix.isi.uu.nl/
%
% FILENAMEOUT = transformix(T, FILENAMEIN)
% IMOUT = transformix(T, IMIN)
%
%   T is a struct, or the path and name of a text file with the transform
%   parameters. Typically, this is the output of a call to elastix, the
%   registration program. See help to elastix for details.
%
%   The input image can be provided either as a string with the path and
%   filename (FILENAMEIN) or as an image array (IMIN). The output will have
%   the same format (i.e. a path to an output file, or an image array). As
%   transformix only uses the first channel in an image and ignores the
%   rest, colour images are converted to grayscale before transforming
%   them.
%
%   FILENAMEOUT or IMOUT is the output transformed image.
%
% ... = transformix(..., OPTS)
%
%   OPTS is a struct with options:
%
%     verbose: (def 0) 1 = show transformix output on screen.
%
%     outfile: path and filename to output image. If none is provided, a
%       random filename in the temp directory is created. This option is
%       ignored if the input/output images are given in array form.
