% SCIMAT_LCONVHULL_SMOOTHING  Smoothing of a binary image using a local
% convex hull.
%
% SCIMAT2 = scimat_lconvhull_smoothing(SCIMAT, RAD)
%
%   SCIMAT is a SCI MAT volume with a binary image. This binary image is
%   assumed to not have holes. It can consist of several non-connected
%   components, but none of them can have any holes.
%
%   The perimeter voxels of the image are selected. The alpha-shape of
%   their coordinates produces a mesh triangulation with the local convex
%   hull.
%
%   Then, rays are traced from the centre of each voxel within the bounding
%   box of the mesh. The number of intersections with the mesh allows to
%   know whether the voxel is inside or outside of it. This part uses
%   cgal_insurftri(), which is very precise but can be a bit slow for very
%   large images.
%
%   RAD is a scalar with the radius of the alpha shape, i.e. the size of
%   the convex hull neighbourhood. When the convex hull is computed, only
%   voxels within RAD distance can be connected. When RAD=Inf, the
%   convex hull is obtained. Note that if you want to compare to other
%   alpha shape functions, e.g. cgal_alpha_shape3() or
%   cgal_fixed_alpha_shape3(), ALPHA=RAD^2.
%
%   SCIMAT2 is the local convex hull of SCIMAT.
%
% SCIMAT2 = scimat_lconvhull_smoothing(SCIMAT, RAD, false, DILRAD)
%
%   To allow for faster processing when the above method using
%   cgal_insurftri() is too slow, we allow an "unsafe" mode. This method
%   uses itk_tri_rasterization(), which is faster but less reliable.
%
%   The inside of the triangulation is converted to voxels using
%   itk_tri_rasterization(). As this function can misclassify quite a few
%   voxels that should be labelled as 1, we run it three times permuting
%   the coordinates of the mesh and the resulting image, and combining the
%   results with an OR. Finally, we run a hole filling algorithm in case
%   any voxels within the mesh were missed.
%
%   DILRAD is the radius of the dilation algorithm that is used internally
%   to fix artifacts by itk_tri_rasterization(). Larger values of DILRAD
%   are a safer bet that artifacts are removed, but it also makes the
%   function slower. By default DILRAD=10.
%
%
% This function uses alphavol() by Jonas Lundgren, which is faster than the
% alpha shape functions in the CGAL library because the latter need to use
% a rather slow Delaunay triangulation first.
%
