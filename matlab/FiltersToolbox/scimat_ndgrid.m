function [xg, yg, zg] = scimat_ndgrid(scimat, ri, ci, si)
% SCIMAT_NDGRID  Generation of arrays for 3D SCIMAT image volumes.
%
% [XG, YG, ZG] = scimat_ndgrid(SCIMAT)
%
%   SCIMAT is a struct with an image volume (see "help scimat" for
%   details).
%
%   XG, YG, ZG are arrays with the x-, y-, z-coordinates of the voxels in
%   SCIMAT.
%
%   Note that XG values change with columns, and YG values change with
%   rows, to accommodate the usual coordinate frame convention.
%
% [XG, YG, ZG] = scimat_ndgrid(SCIMAT, RI, CI, SI)
%
%   RI, CI, SI are vectors of voxel indices (rows, columns and slices). The
%   output grid will be generated only for the corresponding image block.
%   For example, RI=1:4, CI=3:6, SI=5:7 means that the grid of coordinates
%   will be generated only for the block of voxels (1:4, 3:6, 5:7).
