function scimat = scimat_squeeze(scimat, todouble)
% SCIMAT_SQUEEZE  Remove dummy dimension from SCIRUNNRRD struct so that it
% becomes a SCIMAT struct.
%
% SCIMAT = scimat_squeeze(SCIRUNNRRD)
%
%   When the application Seg3D saves images to Matlab format, it saves them
%   to a SCIRUNNRRD struct, which is basically SCIMAT with a dummy
%   dimension.
%
%   SCIMAT is a struct that contains a 3D volume. We use SCIMAT structs
%   widely in Gerardus, because that way we have the image data and
%   metainformation (e.g. voxel size) together in the same
%   variable. For details on SCIMAT structs, see "help scimat".
%
%   This function removes the dummy dimension.
%
% SCIMAT = scimat_squeeze(..., TODOUBLE)
%
%   TODOUBLE is a flag to convert the image data from uint8 to double. This
%   is useful for image processing, but the data will be 8 times larger. By
%   default, TODOUBLE=false.
