function scimat = scimat_crop(scimat, from, to)
% SCIMAT_CROP  Crop a SCIMAT image or segmentation volume of any dimension.
%
% SCIMAT2 = scimat_crop(SCIMAT, FROM, TO)
%
%   SCIMAT is a struct with a metainfo-enriched image or segmentation (see
%   "help scimat" for details). The image can have any number of
%   dimensions.
%
%   FROM, TO are vectors with the index coordinates that define the
%   cropping box. The number of indices depend on the dimensionality of the
%   image. For example, for a 3D volume, FROM=[2 3 7], TO=[15 20 22].
%
%   If FROM or TO don't have all the dimensions, those dimensions are not
%   cropped. E.g. in an image with size [256 512 128 10],
%
%     FROM=[50 75];
%     TO=[100 89];
%
%   is the same as
%
%     FROM=[50 75 1 1];
%     TO=[100 89 128 10];
%
%   If FROM=[] and TO=[], or they are not given as input argument, then the
%   image is not cropped.
%
%   SCIMAT2 is the output cropped volume.
%
% Example:
%
%   % create example scimat struct
%   scimat = scimat_im2scimat(zeros(256, 512, 128), [2 3 5], [-3.0 7.0 11.0]);
%
%   % crop struct
%   scimat2 = scimat_crop(scimat, [50 75], [100 89]);
