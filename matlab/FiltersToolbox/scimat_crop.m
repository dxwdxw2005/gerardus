function scimat = scimat_crop(scimat, from, to)
% SCIMAT_CROP  Crop a SCIMAT image or segmentation volume.
%
% SCIMAT2 = scimat_crop(SCIMAT, FROM, TO)
%
%   SCIMAT is a SCIMAT image or segmentation volume (see "help scimat" for
%   details).
%
%   FROM, TO are vectors with the index coordinates that define the
%   cropping box. For example, FROM=[2 3 7], TO=[15 20 22].
%
%   SCIMAT2 is the cropped volume.
