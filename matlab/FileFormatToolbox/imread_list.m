function im = imread_list(pathstr, file, TOGRAY)
% IMREAD_LIST  Read list of image files into volume.
%
% IMREAD_LIST reads a list of image files, converts them to grayscale if
% desired, and collates them to form a 3D or 4D image volume.
%
% IM = IMREAD_LIST(PATHSTR, FILE)
%
%   PATHSTR is a string with the path to the files. All images must be the
%   same size and have the same number of channels.
%
%   FILE is an array of structs obtained with dir().
%
%   IM is the resulting image volume with indices:
%
%     IM(rows, columns, slice, channel)
%
% IM = IMREAD_LIST(..., TOGRAY)
%
%   TOGRAY is a boolean to convert colour images to grayscale. By default,
%   TOGRAY='false'.
