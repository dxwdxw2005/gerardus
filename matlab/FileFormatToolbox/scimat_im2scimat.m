function scimat = scimat_im2scimat(im, res, offset, rotmat)
% SCIMAT_IM2SCIMAT  Create SCIMAT struct from scratch.
%
% This function creates a struct with the scimat format (see "help scimat"
% for details).
%
% SCIMAT = scimat_im2scimat(IM, RES, OFFSET, ROTMAT)
%
%   IM is a Matlab array with the image or segmentation. IM can be of class
%   logical, (u)int8, (u)int16, (u)int32, (u)int64, single or double. IM
%   can have 3 to 4 dimensions.
%
%   RES is a vector with the voxel size. By default, RES is 1.0 in each
%   dimension.
%
%   OFFSET is a 3-vector with the coordinates of the *centre* of the first
%   voxel in the image.
%
%   Note that the order of RES and OFFSET is the same as the axes in IM.
%   E.g. for a 4D image
%
%     RES(1) --> rows     (y axis)
%     RES(2) --> columns  (x axis)
%     RES(3) --> slices   (z axis)
%     RES(4) --> frames   (t axis)
%
%   ROTMAT is a rotation matrix. By default, ROTMAT=[], which means that no
%   rotation is applied. This is a better solution than using an identity
%   matrix, e.g. because a 3D image could represent a 2D+t or 3D image,
%   which requires a (2,2)- or (3,3)-rotation matrix, respectively.
