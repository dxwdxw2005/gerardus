function [dcm, dcminfo] = load_dcm(files, pth)
% LOAD_DCM  Load array of DICOM filenames as 3D+t image and metainformation
% matrix.
%
% [DCM, DCMINFO] = LOAD_DCM(FILES, PTH)
%
%   FILES, PTH are the output variables of function load_multi_dcm_dir().
%
%   FILES is an array of structs with information for each DICOM file in
%   the set. FILES(I) corresponds to the I-th slice. Each slice contains
%   files for each temporal frame.
%
%   PTH is a string with the path to the DICOMDIR file.
%
%   DCM is a 4-D array with the DICOM images. The format is 
%   DCM(row, column, slice, time frame).
%
%   DCMINFO is a matrix of structs. DCMINFO(slice, time frame) contains the
%   metainformation for the corresponding slice and time frame in the data
%   set.
