function x = scimat_index2world(idx, ax, CHOP)
% scimat_index2world  Convert image indices to real world coordinates for
% the SCIMAT image struct that we use in Gerardus.
%
%   Function scimat_index2world() converts the coordinates of a voxel given
%   as index coordinates [row, column, slice] into its real world
%   coordinates [x, y, z].
%
%      [r, c, s] -> [x, y, z]
%
%   This agrees with Matlab's convention that images are expected to be
%   (r, c, s) <-> (y, x, z), but point coordinates are given in the
%   (x, y, z)-order.
%
%   For points that are not within the data volume, the returned
%   coordinates are "NaN".
%
% X = scimat_index2world(IDX, AXIS)
%
%   IDX has the same size as X, and the voxel indices in 
%   (row, column, slice)-order, that corresponds to (y, x, z)-order.
%
%   AXIS is the scimat.axis field from a SCIMAT struct (see "help
%   scimat_load" for details).
%
%   X is a 3-column matrix where each row contains the real world
%   (x, y, z)-coordinates of a point.
%
% IDX = scimat_index2world(..., CHOP)
%
%   CHOP is a flag to convert points outside the image volume to NaNs. By
%   default, CHOP=true.
%
%
% Example:
%
% >> x = scimat_index2world([55 189 780], scimat.axis)
%
% x =
%
%     .0100, .0110, .0200
