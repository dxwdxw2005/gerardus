function x = scimat_index2world(idx, scimat, CHOP)
% SCIMAT_INDEX2WORLD  Convert image indices to real world coordinates for
% the SCIMAT image struct that we use in Gerardus.
%
%   Function SCIMAT_INDEX2WORLD() converts the coordinates of a voxel given
%   as index coordinates [row, column, slice, frame] into its real world
%   coordinates [x, y, z, t].
%
%      [r, c, s, f] -> [x, y, z, t]
%
%   This agrees with Matlab's convention that images are expected to be 
%   (r, c) <-> (y, x), but point coordinates are given in the (x, y)-order.
%
%   This function can also be applied to images that are not 4D, and in
%   that case, index and real world coordinates will have the same number
%   of elements as dimensions the image has.
%
%   The relation between indices IDX and real world coordinates X is
%
%     X = s.*(IDX-1)*R + t
%
%   where s is the voxel size, R the rotation matrix, and t the
%   image offset.
%
%   For points that are not within the data volume, the returned
%   coordinates are "NaN".
%
% X = SCIMAT_INDEX2WORLD(IDX, SCIMAT)
%
%   IDX has one element per image dimension. If the image is 4D, IDX is
%   given in (row, column, slice, frame)-order.
%
%   SCIMAT is a struct with the image and axis metadata, i.e. spacing,
%   offset and orientation (see "help scimat" for details). SCIMAT.data
%   (the field that contains the image itself) is not used by the function,
%   and thus can be present or absent. Note that Matlab will pass
%   SCIMAT.data by reference, so passing the whole image does not require
%   more memory and does not slow the function down.
%
%   X is a 3-column matrix where each row contains the real world
%   (x, y, z, t)-coordinates of a point.
%
% IDX = SCIMAT_INDEX2WORLD(..., CHOP)
%
%   CHOP is a flag to convert points outside the image volume to NaNs. By
%   default, CHOP=true.
%
%
% Example:
%
% >> x = scimat_index2world([55 189 780], scimat)
%
% x =
%
%     .0100, .0110, .0200
