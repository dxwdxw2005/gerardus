function scimat = scimat_seg3d2matlab(scimat)
% SCIMAT_SEG3D2MATLAB  Correct dimensions of data loaded from a *.mat file
% created with Seg3D so that it will follow Matlab's convention.
%
% SCIMAT = scimat_seg3d2matlab(SCIRUNNRRD)
%
%   Seg3D displays images with x-coordinates spanning columns, and
%   y-coordinates spanning rows. However, when segmentations are exported
%   to Matlab files, it swaps this convention. Thus, when you load a
%   segmentation mask in Matlab, coordinates are inverted: x-coords span
%   rows and y-coords span columns.
%
%   This function undoes the swapping, so that the image loaded in Matlab
%   will follow the convention x <-> columns, y <-> rows.
%
%   SCIRUNNRRD is a struct loaded from a .mat file created with the
%   software application Seg3D.
%
%   SCIMAT is a struct with the order of rows and columns corrected so that
%   it follows Matlab's convention.
