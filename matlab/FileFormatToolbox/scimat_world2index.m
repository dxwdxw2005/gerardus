function idx = scimat_world2index(x, ax, CHOP)
% SCIMAT_WORLD2INDEX  Convert real world coordinates to image indices for
% the SCIMAT image struct that we use in Gerardus.
% 
%   Function scimat_world2index() converts the coordinates of a voxel given
%   as real world coordinates [x, y, z] into index coordinates 
%   [row, column, slice].
%
%      [x, y, z] -> [r, c, s]
%
%   This agrees with Matlab's convention that images are expected to be
%   (r, c, s) <-> (y, x, z), but point coordinates are given in the
%   (x, y, z)-order.
%
%   For points that are not within the data volume, the returned
%   indices are "NaN".
%
%   Note also that the indices are not rounded, to allow for sub-pixel
%   accuracy. If integer indices are required, then just use round(idx).
%
% IDX = scimat_world2index(X, AXIS)
%
%   X is a 3-column matrix where each row contains the real world
%   (x,y,z)-coordinates of a point.
%
%   IDX has the same size as X, and the voxel indices in 
%   (row, column, slice)-order, that corresponds to (y, x, z)-order.
%
%   AXIS is the scimat.axis field from a SCIMAT struct (see "help
%   scimat_load" for details).
%
% IDX = scimat_world2index(..., CHOP)
%
%   CHOP is a flag to convert points outside the image volume to NaNs. By
%   default, CHOP=true.
%
%
% Example:
%
% >> idx = scimat_world2index([.01, .011, .02], scimat.axis)
%
% idx =
%
%     55   189   780
