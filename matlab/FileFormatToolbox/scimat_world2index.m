function idx = scimat_world2index(x, scimat, CHOP)
% SCIMAT_WORLD2INDEX  Convert real world coordinates to image indices for
% the SCIMAT image struct that we use in Gerardus.
% 
%   Function SCIMAT_WORLD2INDEX() converts the coordinates of a voxel given
%   as real world coordinates [x, y, z, t] into index coordinates 
%   [row, column, slice, frame].
%
%      [x, y, z, t] -> [r, c, s, f]
%
%   This agrees with Matlab's convention that images are expected to be
%   (r, c, s) <-> (y, x, z), but point coordinates are given in the
%   (x, y, z)-order.
%
%   This function can also be applied to images that are not 4D, and in
%   that case, idex and real world coordinates will have the same number of
%   elements as dimensions the image has.
%
%   For points that are not within the data volume, the returned
%   indices are "NaN".
%
%   Note also that the indices are not rounded, to allow for sub-pixel
%   accuracy. If integer indices are required, then just use round(idx).
%
% IDX = SCIMAT_WORLD2INDEX(X, SCIMAT)
%
%   X is a 3-column matrix where each row contains the real world
%   (x,y,z)-coordinates of a point.
%
%   IDX has the same size as X, and the voxel indices in 
%   (row, column, slice)-order, that corresponds to (y, x, z)-order.
%
%   SCIMAT is a struct with the image space metadata, i.e. spacing, offset
%   and orientation (see "help scimat" for details). SCIMAT.data (the fild
%   that contains the image itself) is not used by the function, and thus
%   can be present or absent. Note that Matlab will pass SCIMAT.data by
%   reference, so passing the whole image does not require more memory or
%   slow the function down.
%
% IDX = SCIMAT_WORLD2INDEX(..., CHOP)
%
%   CHOP is a flag to convert points outside the image volume to NaNs. By
%   default, CHOP=true.
%
%
% Example:
%
% >> idx = scimat_world2index([.01, .011, .02], scimat)
%
% idx =
%
%     55   189   780
