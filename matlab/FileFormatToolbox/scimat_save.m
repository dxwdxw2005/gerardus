function scirunnrrd = scimat_save(file, scirunnrrd, touint8, v73)
% SCIMAT_SAVE  Save a SCIMAT struct to a Matlab or MetaImage format that
% can be imported by Seg3D and Seg3D2.
%
% scimat_save(FILE, SCIMAT)
%
%   This function formats the SCIMAT volume and saves it to a .mat or .mha
%   file that can be imported as a segmentation or image volume by Seg3D.
%
%   FILE is a string with the path and name of the output .mat/.mha file.
%
%   SCIMAT is the struct with the image data and metadata. For example,
%
%   scimat = 
%   
%           data: [415x460x900 single]
%           axis: [3x1 struct]
%       property: []
%
%   where the dimensions follow the convention:
%
%     axis(1) ==> rows
%     axis(2) ==> columns
%     axis(3) ==> slices
%
%   We call the image struct SCIMAT because it's based on the struct
%   generated by the visualization platform Seg3D, developed by the
%   University of Utah Scientific Computing and Imaging (SCI) Institute,
%   when you save an image or segmentation to Matlab format. Seg3D itself
%   saves the structure with the name "scirunnrrd".
%
%   >>  scirunnrrd
%
%   scirunnrrd = 
%
%          data: [4-D uint8]
%          axis: [4x1 struct]
%      property: []
%
% scimat_save(FILE, SCIMAT, TOUINT8)
%
%   TOUINT8 is a flag to convert the image data from double to uint8. This
%   will make the volume 8 times smaller. By default, TOUINT8=false.
%
% scimat_save(FILE, SCIMAT, TOUINT8, V73)
%
%   V73 is a boolean flag to save the data to Matlab's HDF5-based MAT file
%   format v7.3. The reason is that if you volume is >= 2GB, Matlab skips
%   saving it and gives the warning message:
%
%      "Warning: Variable 'scirunnrrd' cannot be saved to a MAT-file whose
%      version is older than 7.3.
%      To save this variable, use the -v7.3 switch.
%      Skipping..."
%
%   This is a limitation of the v7 format. Read more here
%
%      http://www.mathworks.com/help/techdoc/rn/bqt6wls.html
%
%   However, note that Seg3D 1.x cannot read v7.3 files. By default,
%   V73=false.
%
% SCIRUNNRRD = scimat_save(...)
%
%   SCIRUNNRRD gives the "scirunnrrd" struct actually saved to the file.
