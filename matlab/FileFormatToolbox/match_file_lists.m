function [x, y, xidx, yidx] = match_file_lists(x, y, xnameidx, ynameidx)
% match_file_lists  Remove elements from a file list that are not in
% another.
%
% [X2, Y2, XIDX, YIDX] = match_file_lists(X, Y, XNAMEIDX, YNAMEIDX)
%
%   X, Y are file lists obtained with dir(). X, Y are arrays of structs
%   with a field X.name, Y.name for the filenames.
%
%   XNAMEIDX, YNAMEIDX are indices that determine which part of the
%   filenames are matched.
%
%   X2, Y2 are the returned lists. X2 is X minus the elements not found in
%   Y. Y2 is Y minus the elements not found in X.
%
%   XIDX, YIDX are the indices of the matched elements. X2 = X(XIDX),
%   Y2 = Y(YIDX).
%
%   For example,
%
%   X(1).name = 'Q53_55_0004.png';
%
%   Y(1).name = 'Q53_002 - 2014-06-24 16.43.14.png';
%   Y(2).name = 'Q53_004 - 2014-06-24 16.44.51.png';
%   Y(3).name = 'Q53_006 - 2014-06-24 16.46.35.png';
%
%   XNAMEIDX = 9:11;
%   YNAMEIDX = 5:7;
%
%   This function matches X(1).name(9:11) = '004' to the other three
%   elements, '002', '004' and '006'. Because there's a match with the
%   second element in Y, the function returns
%
%   X = X(1).name;
%   Y = Y(2).name;
