function [v, d, m] = scimat_pca(scimat)
% SCIMAT_PCA Principal Principal Component Analysis of the selected points
% in a SCIMAT segmentation mask.
%
% [V, D, M] = scimat_pca(SCIMAT)
%
%   This function computes Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the
%   collection of points in a SCIMAT segmentation mask.
%
%   SCIMAT is a struct with the segmentation (see "help scimat" for
%   details).
%
%   V is a matrix with the column eigenvectors ordered in decreasing order
%   of the corresponding eigenvalues in D.
%
%   M is a 3-vector with the coordinates of the dataset centroid. The
%   centroid is the centre of the coordinate system defined by the
%   eigenvectors, and the centre of rotation if the data is rotated.
%
%   Assuming a 3D volume, V is a (3, 3)-matrix and D a 3-vector.
