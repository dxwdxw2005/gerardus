function x = triuvec(x, k)
% triuvec  Extract upper triangular part into vector form.
%
% Matlab's triu() returns a matrix, with all elements below the upper
% triangular part equal to 0. triuvec() extracts only the elements in the
% upper triangular part, and returns them as a vector.
%
% Y = triuvec(X)
%
%   X is a matrix.
%
%   Y is the upper triangular part of X in vector form.
%
% Y = triuvec(X, K)
%
%   K selects another diagonal. K>0 is above the main diagonal and K<0 is
%   below the main diagonal.
%
% See also: triu.
