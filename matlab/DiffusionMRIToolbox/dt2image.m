function [ img ] = dt2image( DT, b )
% DT2IMAGE Inverts the transform in fit_DT
% 
% The suggested usage of this file is to easily check how well a diffusion
% tensor fits to your data. Eg:
%
% DT = fit_DT( im, b );
% im_fitted = dt2image(DT, b);
% residuals = im_fitted - im;
%
% Ideally the residuals would be just noise - if there is any pattern to
% them, the model might not be a good fit.
%
%   DT is the diffusion tensor coefficients
%   b is the b values
%   img is the reconstructed image
%
% See also fit_DT
