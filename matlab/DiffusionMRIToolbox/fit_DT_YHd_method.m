function [DT, FA, ADC, EigVects, EigVals] = fit_DT_YHd_method(s, s0, dirdata, bdata )
%FIT_DT_YHD_METHOD Calculates the diffusion tensor to a set of diffusion
%MRI images
%
% inputs:
%   s = image data (diffusion value) 3D or 4D matrix, with final dimension
%   is the number of images/scans (N)
%   s0 = image data for b-value of 0 (or near 0), i.e. the reference image,
%   2D or 3D image
%   dirdata = unit vectors of the gradient direction [N 3]
%   bdata = b-value for each image [N 1]
%
% outputs:
%   DT = diffusion tensor components (dxx, dxy, dxz, dyy, dyz, dzz)
%   FA = fractional anisotropy
%   ADC = apparant diffusion coefficient
%   EigVects = eigenvectors of the DT
%   EigVals = eigenvalues of the DT
%
% Basic equation to be solved is Y = Hd + noise (solving for d), from
% Kingsley, 'Introduction to DTI mathematics: part III'. Concepts in
% Magnetic Resonance Park A, 2006
% Y is the matrix of the image magnitude, and b-value
% H is the matrix of the diffusion directions
% d is the vector of the components of the diffusion tensor
