function [COU, FA_STD, ADC_STD] = wild_bootstrapping_DTI( I, bval, Mask, Nreps )
% WILD_BOOTSTRAPPING_DTI Returns uncertainty measures from diffusion tensor
% images via wild bootstrapping. See Whitcher 2008 - Using the Wild 
% Bootstrap to Quantify Uncertainty in Diffusion Tensor Imaging
%
%
% Inputs:
%
%   I is the input image, of any dimensionality, with the diffusion 
%   scans in the last dimension
%     
%   BVAL is the b-matrix, of size [3 3 N]
%
%   MASK is the mask of voxels for analysis, same size as the first N-1
%   dimensions of I
%
%   NREPS is the number of Monte Carlo repetitions (default 1000)
%
% Outputs:
%
%   COU is the cone of uncertainty (in degrees) (See Jones 2003 - 
%   Determining and Visualizing Uncertainty in Estimates of Fiber 
%   Orientation From Diffusion Tensor MRI). Here, the 95th percentile is
%   returned.
%
%   FA_STD is the standard deviation of the fractional anisotropy over 
%   the repetitions
%
%   ADC_STD is the standard deviation of the ADC over the repetitions
